## Overview

The disOrderly SaaS project is a research and development initiative aimed at designing a cloud-hosted Software as a Service (SaaS) application with a focus on motivational design strategies and user-centered principles. This project explores the potential of SaaS applications to drive behavioral change, improve user experiences, and create positive engagement.

The project serves real-world use cases, particularly the **V(l)inder** project, which helps adults with disabilities form meaningful social connections.
